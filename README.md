Repository containing details about the survey conducted with SG practitioners.
The repository contains two PDF files, one including the 27 closed questions asked to the 14 Private Companies, and another containing 10 closed questions asked to the 4 Public Authorities.


We suggest *downloading* the PDF files and open them with Adobe Acrobat, as they may render inccorectly on some pdf viewers.
