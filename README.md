# smartgrid_survey
This repository contains details on the paper "Cybersecurity in the Smart Grid: Practitioners' Perspective".

Specifically, the repository contains three files:
 * "questionnaire_privateCompanies.pdf", containing the 27 closed questions asked to the 14 Private Companies 
 * "questionnaire_publicAuthorities.pdf", containing the 10 closed questions asked to the 4 Public Authorities
 * "figures.ipynb", containing the source-code for generating the figures included in the main paper (specifying the actual numbers included in each "bin" or "boxplot").

We suggest **downloading** the PDF files and open them with a PDF reader (e.g., Adobe Reader), as they may render inccorectly on this anonymised repository.
